# Coursera Project - Shiny Application
The shinyDiamonds repository has one application with ui.R and server.R files
The app is designed to predict the price (in Singapore Dollars) of a diamond
based on the weight of the diamond.

UsingR package was used with the diamond data set for this excercise.

Simply move the slider to the desired weight and a reactive red do will be plotted
for the price with the estmated price shown below the plot. A linear model was fitted for the
data so you have the option to also display or hide the model.
